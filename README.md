# Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Simulation

This project is a simulation of an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) using Pygame. The AMR can be controlled using keyboard inputs or by clicking on the screen to set a target position for the robot.

## Features

- AMR movement: The AMR can be moved forward and backward, and can be rotated left and right.
- Trajectory planning: The AMR can plan its trajectory to reach a target position in the fastest possible combination of rotary and linear movement.
- Interface: The interface displays the current position (X, Y) and angle of the AMR.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- Pygame

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using pip:# mobile-robot-pygame-simulation
initial
`pip pygame`

### Usage

Run the `main.py` script to start the simulation.

## Files

- `AMR.py`: Contains the `AMR` class which represents the Autonomous Mobile Robot.
- `interface.py`: Contains the `Interface` class which represents the interface of the simulation.
- `assets.py`: Contains the assets used in the simulation such as color constants and screen dimensions.
- `main.py`: Contains the main function which initializes and runs the simulation.
